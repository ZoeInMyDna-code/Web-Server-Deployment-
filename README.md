## 🧩 Project Description  
This repository contains my submission for the **HNG13 Stage 0 DevOps Challenge**.  
The task involves setting up and managing a GitHub workflow, deploying and configuring an **NGINX web server**, and serving a **custom webpage** accessible from the internet via HTTP (port 80).  

The webpage displays:
- My name and Slack username  
- The deployment platform  
- The deployment date  

This project demonstrates my ability to configure, deploy, and manage a live web server—an essential DevOps skill required in production environments.
